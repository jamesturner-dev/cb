# THIS IS NOT READY FOR THE WORLD

### I had an idea about tracking all the links from my various enterprises. I then thought that I really should use like a short url type scheme. And maybe share a directory of those links...

## TLDR;

This is in no way, shape, or form finished software. It will be done in due time, however is does show how I do full stack at this point.

#### Tools / Tech

- [Node / Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [MongoDb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

### This will not run as is from this repository

It needs the config file for connecting to the db, etc. I will figure out what the best practice is for including dummy file(s).
