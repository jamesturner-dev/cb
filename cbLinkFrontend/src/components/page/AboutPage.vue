          Not too long ago I got fired from my job.
          <span class="text-purple-700"> Without cause</span>. The worst part
          about it was that I could not continue working on the project I was
          the sole developer on. You know, it was
          <span class="text-purple-700">my</span> project.

        <p class="text-gray-600 font-bold mt-10 text-xl">
          Not legally of course, so I had to let it go.

        <p class="text-gray-500 dark:gray-300 mt-5">
          I had a couple of projects I had started before that gig, one being
          <a class="text-purple-700" href="https://headlin3s.com">
            Headlin3s
          </a>
          but I wanted to create something new and fresh. That did things the
          way I wanted them to be done each step of the way. I also wanted to
          create something that I could get posted before my severance ran out
          as a resume piece.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-500 mt-5">
          I decided to create a system to track all the links from my various
          web projects. I decided to go ahead and implement a short url type of
          scheme, and then I thought why not create some directory type views of
          the links?

        <h2 class="text-gray-600 font-bold my-5 text-xl">
          It would be cooler if it was multi-user
        </h2>

        <p class="text-gray-500">
          It still felt a little flimsy so I thought - why not make it multi
          user so other people could use it to create their own directory and
          manage their own links?

          If nothing else it does show how I approach a full stack project. You
